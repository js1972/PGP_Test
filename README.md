PGP_Test
========
This repo contains some test classes for working with PGP encyrption. It is based on the BouncyCastle library (http://www.bouncycastle.org/).
It shows how to encrypt and decrypt using files with all the associated PGP options...

The required jar files are located at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cjvwqf8b6freagp/ZdOuU5HqcE but can also be found on the BouncyCastle website (if you're brave!).
